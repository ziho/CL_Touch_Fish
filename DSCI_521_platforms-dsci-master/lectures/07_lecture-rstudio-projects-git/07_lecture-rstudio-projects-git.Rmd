# Lecture learning goals:

### By the end of this week, you should be able to:

--

- Create an RStudio project

--

- Edit/customize RStudio project settings 

--

- Use RStudio as a Git client to manage your project's version control

--

- Set `knitr` options and use `rmarkdown::render` to reproducibly render a R Markdown document somewhere other than the root of your project

--
---

# RStudio projects

- A directory containing a special file: `*.Rproj`

- Allows you to do the following awesome/useful things:

  - use RStudio as a Git client
  
  - never save workspace to `.Rdata` when quitting RStudio
  
  - never restore `.Rdata` into your workspace when starting RStudio

---

## Creating RStudio projects

Because we use version control with everything in Data Science...

1. Start by making a GitHub repo

2. Copy the URL needed to clone that repo from GitHub

3. Then select File > New Project > Version Control > Git and fill in:

  - Repository URL
  
  - Create Project as a subdirectory of

**Give it a try!**

---

## Where is your working directory?

- After you successfully created an R project, your working directory should now be the R Project's root directory. 

**Verify that by typing `getwd()` in your R console**

---

## Editing RStudio project settings

--

- In general, we NEVER want to save our workspace (or load a previous one).

--

- We can avoid accidentally doing this through editing the RStudio project settings.

--

- Project options are found under Tools > project options.

--

**Try editing your project options to never save or load your workspace from `.Rdata`**

--

---

## Using RStudio to drive Git

- RStudio can be used as a Git Client/GUI to `add`, `commit`, `push` and `pull` your changes. 

- This only works IF you have a `.Rproj` file.

- The machinery to do this is in a tab of the Environment/History pane of RStudio.

**Try creating a `README.md` file in your R project and pushing those changes to GitHub. Visit GitHub to verify that they made it there.**

---

## Use `.Rproj` to open Rstudio

- You can double click on the `.Rproj` file of an RStudio project to open RStudio.

- When you do this, it also sets the currentl working directory to be the RStudio project's working directory.

- This is pretty nice!

## Taking control of `knitr` and `rmarkdown::render`

Last lab when you created R Markdown documents, you left them in the project root. This made for a less than organised project.

Let's learn to knit/render a document that lives in the `doc` directory.

Let's start by exploring this demo: https://github.com/ttimbers/equine_numbers_value_canada_rmd

---

## How did we do this?

- specify `knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())` in the your setup code chunk

---

## But I want my figures in the results directory?

Or somehwere else...

---

- Maybe this isn't ideal, but its better than having everything in the project root

---

- This lack of flexibility is intentional stems from the developer's ([Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/)) philosophy

---

- Not everyone agrees, and so we also have the [`ezknitr`](https://github.com/ropensci/ezknitr) package (but this might not be actively maintained, so use with caution...)

## Go forth and practice
