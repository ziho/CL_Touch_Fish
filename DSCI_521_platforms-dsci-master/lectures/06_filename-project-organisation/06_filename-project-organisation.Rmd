## Warm-up discussion:

- Let's share our past file management choices, successes and failures.
- For example:
  - are there file names that have caused you (or are causing you) headaches?
  - are there projects or aspects to your computer's organization structure that have made things hard to find?
  
## Names matter

## What works, what doesn't?

## Three principles for (file) names

1. Machine readable

2. Human readable

3. Plays well with default ordering

## Awesome file names :)

# Machine readable

## Machine readable

- Regular expression and globbing friendly
    + Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity

- Easy to compute on
    + Deliberate use of delimiters
    
## Globbing

**Excerpt of complete file listing:**

![plasmid_names](img/plasmid_names.png)

<hr>

**Example of globbing to narrow file listing:**

![plasmid_names](img/plasmid_glob.png)


## Same using Mac OS Finder search facilities

## Same using regex in R

</center>

## Punctuation {.smaller}

Deliberate use of `"-"` and `"_"` allows recovery of meta-data from the filenames:

- `"_"` underscore used to delimit units of meta-data I want later
- `"-"` hyphen used to delimit words so my eyes don't bleed

This happens to be R but also possible in the shell, Python, etc.

## Recap: machine readable

- Easy to search for files later

- Easy to narrow file lists based on names

- Easy to extract info from file names, e.g. by splitting

- New to regular expressions and globbing? be kind to yourself and avoid
    + Spaces in file names
    + Punctuation
    + Accented characters
    + Different files named `foo` and `Foo`
    
# Human readable

## Human readable

- Name contains info on content

- Connects to concept of a *slug* from semantic URLs

## Example

**Which set of file(name)s do you want at 3 a.m. before a deadline?**

![human_readable_not_options](img/human_readable_not_options.png)

## Embrace the slug

<div class="columns-2">
slug filenames
![](img/slug_filenames.png)

slug
![](img/slug.jpg)
</div>

## Recap: Human readable

Easy to figure out what the heck something is, based on its name

# Plays well with default ordering

## Plays well with default ordering

- Put something numeric first

- Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

- Left pad other numbers with zeros

## Examples

**Chronological order:**

![chronological_order](img/chronological_order.png)

<hr>

**Logical order:** Put something numeric first

![logical_order](img/logical_order.png)

## Dates

Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates: YYYY-MM-DD

![chronological_order](img//chronological_order.png)

## Left pad other numbers with zeros

If you don’t left pad, you get this:

~~~
10_final-figs-for-publication.R
1_data-cleaning.R
2_fit-model.R
~~~

which is just sad :(

## Recap: Plays well with default ordering

- Put something numeric first

- Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

- Left pad other numbers with zeros

## Recap

## Three principles for (file) names

1. Machine readable

2. Human readable

3. Plays well with default ordering

## Pros

- Easy to implement NOW

- Payoffs accumulate as your skills evolve and projects get more complex

## Go forth and use awesome file names :)

## Data analysis workflow

![workflow](img/workflow.png)

## Face it...

- There are going to be files

- LOTS of files

- The files will change over time

- The files will have relationships to each other

- It'll probably get complicated

## Mighty weapon

- File organization and naming is a mighty weapon against chaos

- Make a file's name and location VERY INFORMATIVE about what it is, why it exists, how it relates to other things

- The more things are self-explanatory, the better

- READMEs are great, but don't document something if you could just make that thing self-documenting by definition

# Organizing your data analysis workflow

## Data

Ready to analyze data:

![sample_ready_to_analyze_data](img/sample_ready_to_analyze_data.png)

<hr>

Raw data:

![sample_raw_data](img/sample_raw_data.png)


## Analysis and figures

R scripts + the Markdown files from "Compile Notebook":

![sample_ready_to_analyze_data](img/sample_analysis.png)

<hr>

The figures created in those R scripts and linked in those Markdown files:

![sample_raw_data](img/sample_figures.png)

## Scripts

Linear progression of R scripts, and Makefile to run the entire analysis:

![sample_scripts](img/sample_scripts.png)

## Results

Tab-delimited files with one row per gene of parameter estimates, test statistics, etc.:

![sample_results](img/sample_results.png)

## Expository files

Files to help collaborators understand the model we fit: some markdown docs, a Keynote presentation, Keynote slides exported as PNGs for viewability on GitHub:

![sample_expository](img/sample_expository.png)

## Caveats / problems with this example

- This project is no where near done, i.e. no manuscript or publication-ready figs

- File naming has inconsistencies due to three different people being involved

- Code and reports/figures all sit together because it’s just much easier that way w/ knitr & rmarkdown

## Wins of this example

- I can walk away from the project and come back to it a year later and resume work fairly quickly

- The two other people (the post-doc whose project it is + the bioinformatician for that lab) were able to figure out what I did and decide which files they needed to look at, etc.
