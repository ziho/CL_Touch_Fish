<p>
	
By the end of the course, students are expected to:

1. Translate fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, etc into Python code.
2. Understand the key data structures in Python.
3. Understand how to write functions in Python and assess if they are correct via unit testing.
4. Know when and how to abstract code (e.g., into functions, or classes) to make it more modular and robust.
5. Produce human-readable code that incorporates best practices of programming, documentation, and coding style.
6. Use NumPy perform common data wrangling and computational tasks in Python.
7. Use Pandas to create and manipulate data structures like Series and DataFrames.
8. Wrangle different types of data in Pandas including numeric data, strings, and datetimes.

Specific learning objectives can be found in the [Lecture Learning Objectives](lecture_learning_objectives.md) document.
