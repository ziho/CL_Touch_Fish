**Follow the Course List in [MDS_CL](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/computational-linguistics) official website.**

## Block 1

### DSCI 511 - Programming for Data Science

> Program design and data manipulation with Python. Overview of data structures, iteration, flow control, and program design relevant to data exploration and analysis. When and how to exploit pre-existing libraries.



#### Lecture 1 - Basics

- Create, describe and differentiate standard Python data types such as `int`, `float`, `string`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, etc.
- Perform arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `**` on numeric values
- Perform basic string operations like `.lower()`, `.split()` to manipulate strings
- Compute boolean values using comparison operators operations (`==`, `!=`, `>`, etc.) and boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assign, index, slice and subset values to and from tuples, lists, strings and dictionaries
- Write a conditional statement with `if`, `elif` and `else`
- Identify code blocks by levels of indentation
- Explain the difference between mutable objects like a `list` and immutable objects like a `tuple`



#### Lecture 2 - Loops Functions

- Write `for` and `while` loops in Python
- Identify iterable data types which can be used in `for` loops
- Create a `list`, `dictionary`, or `set` using comprehension
- Write a `try`/`except` statement
- Define a function and an anonymous function in Python
- Describe the difference between positional and keyword arguments
- Describe the difference between local and global arguments
- Apply the `DRY principle` to write modular code
- Assess whether a function has side effects
- Write a docstring for a function that describes parameters, return values, behaviour and usage









### DSCI 521 - Computing Platforms for Data Science 

> How to install, maintain, and use the data scientific software stack. The Unix shell, version control, and problem solving strategies. Literate programming documents.



### DSCI 523 - Programming for Data Manipulation 

> Program design and data manipulation with R. Organizing, filtering, sorting, grouping, reformatting, converting, and cleaning data to prepare it for further analysis.



### DSCI 551 - Descriptive Statistics and Probability for Data Science

> Fundamental concepts in probability including conditional, joint, and marginal distributions. Statistical view of data coming from a probability distribution.
