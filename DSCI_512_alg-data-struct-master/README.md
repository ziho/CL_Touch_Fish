## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Analyze the scalability and trade-offs of various basic algorithms and data structures using Big-O notation.
2. Read and interpret recursive functions.
3. Select appropriate data structures, such as graphs, given a data set. 
4. Map certain real-world problems to discrete optimization problems.
5. Diagnose rate-limiting aspects of slow Python code and enumerate various options for speeding it up.
